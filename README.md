# NAME

almond â€“ Edit JSON as YAML

# SYNOPSIS

almond [--help]

# DESCRIPTION

Conveniently edit JSON via a YAML file opened in a bespoke Vim buffer. This
stemmed from a need to edit multi-line strings in JSON data. I guess I could
use something like that in [kibanda](http://cern.ch/jbl/tools/kibanda).
